Outlining Core Features

I'm currently focused on deconstructing the user's request. My initial thought is to identify the core functionality: a free resume builder. This means I need to pinpoint what user details will be required as input. I'm exploring the expected output and the workflow. The goal is to articulate the fundamental "what" of this GitHub repository.

Defining User Input Needs

I'm now zeroing in on the specifics of user input. To generate a functional resume, I need to understand the mandatory and optional data points. I'm considering sections like contact info, experience, skills, and education, ensuring flexibility for various user profiles. The goal is to design an intuitive form. I also need to think about the user's need to upload photos.

Developing Output Specifications

I've shifted focus to defining the ideal output: a downloadable PDF resume. The user's goal should be a sleek, professional document. I'm prioritizing ease of use. I plan on providing clear customization options for formatting and styles. My goal is to strike a balance between simplicity and design. I am now beginning to outline the file naming conventions.

Refining README Structure

I'm now outlining a clear and comprehensive structure for the README.md. I plan to incorporate key sections, including a concise elevator pitch and a visual demonstration to immediately capture user attention. I'll make sure to provide clear instructions for both end-users and developers, addressing setup, usage, and contribution. I am considering the license options.

Defining README Content

I'm now focusing on drafting the content for the README.md file. After a lot of deliberation, I've outlined key sections like the title, a concise elevator pitch highlighting the core functionalities of the project, key features, a direct link to the live demo, and clear instructions for end-users. I've also included a tech stack section and guidelines for contributions. My aim is to create a comprehensive and user-friendly guide.

Outlining the Core Content

I've been working on structuring the content. I'm focusing on the "Key Features" section. Currently, it includes "free to use," "no sign-ups," a "simple interface," and "real-time preview." I'm adding "Download as PDF," emphasizing the main output. I plan to mention multiple templates as a suggestion. I'm working to include the live demo link and the "How To Use" instructions.
